              <p>HMRC will tell you on the original decision  letter sent to you how you can query or challenge a tax decision.</p>
              <p>You usually have 30 days to write to them saying why you think their decision is wrong.</p>
              <p>It is free to ask HMRC to look into your tax issue again. You will usually only have to pay your own costs, for example towards postage, printing or any professional advice.</p>
              <p><strong>You can still appeal to the tax tribunal after challenging HMRC</strong>
              <p>HMRC will send you a letter telling you their view on your tax dispute and whether they've changed their mind.</p>
              <p>If you disagree with HMRC’s response, you can:
              <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>ask HMRC for a review by an officer who wasn’t involved in the original decision. You can still appeal to the tax tribunal afterwards if you do not accept the review conclusion</li>
                <li>consider alternative dispute resolution (ADR)</li>
                <li>appeal to an independent tax tribunal within 30 days</li>
              </ul>
