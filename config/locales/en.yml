      lead_text: Use this service to settle a tax dispute with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
      description_html: >
        <p>The tribunal is <strong>independent of government</strong> and will listen to both sides of the argument before making a decision.</p>
        <p>For more information see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-tribunal/overview">guide to tax tribunals and fees</a>.</p>
        <p>You can make an appeal to the tax tribunal by following each step below.</p>

        <ol class="list list-number util_mt-large">

            <p><strong>Find out how much your appeal costs</strong> (about 5 minutes to complete)</p>
            <details role="group">
              <summary role="button" aria-controls="details-content-0" aria-expanded="false">You will need to pay a fee of £20, £50 or £200 to submit an appeal unless you're eligible for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees">help with fees</a>.</summary>

              <div class="panel" id="details-content-0" aria-hidden="true">
                <p>The initial fee to submit your appeal depends on your type of case.</p>
                <p>You may also have to pay a further fee if your case needs further documents, correspondence and a hearing in person with a judge.</p>
                <p>The judge has the power to decide whether HMRC should reimburse your fees when they look at your case. The tribunal itself does not have the power to enforce or award costs.</p>
                <p>Check if you're able to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees">get help paying your fees</a> if you’re on a low income or receiving certain benefits.</p>

            <p>You usually have 30 days to write to them saying why you think their decision is wrong.</p>
            <p>It is free to ask HMRC to look into your tax issue again. You will usually only have to pay your own costs, for example towards postage, printing or any professional advice.</p>
            <p><strong>You can still appeal to the tax tribunal after challenging HMRC</strong>
            <p>HMRC will send you a letter telling you their view on your tax dispute and whether they've changed their mind.</p>
            <p>If you disagree with HMRC’s response, you can:

              <li>ask HMRC for a review by an officer who wasn’t involved in the original decision. You can still appeal to the tax tribunal afterwards if you do not accept the review conclusion</li>
              <li>consider alternative dispute resolution (ADR)</li>
