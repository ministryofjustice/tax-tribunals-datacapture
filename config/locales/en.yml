          lead_text: You have 30 calendar days from the date of the original notice

          heading_unsure: Are there reasons why your %{appeal_or_application} might
            be late?
          lead_text: The judge will consider your reasons and any response from HMRC.
            There may be a hearing to decide if your %{appeal_or_application} can
            go ahead. If you are not allowed to appeal late, you will be told why
            not.
          lead_text_unsure: To help process your case quickly, you should give reasons
            why your %{appeal_or_application} might be late. The judge will decide
            whether your %{appeal_or_application} can go ahead if it is late.
          details_title: Help with a late %{appeal_or_application}
          details_content: You must provide reasonable grounds for submitting your
            %{appeal_or_application} late. These are usually unforeseen circumstances
            or events beyond your control which meant you weren't able to meet the
            tax tribunal deadline.
