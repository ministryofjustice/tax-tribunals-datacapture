        content_html: |
          <p>A representative can be a:</p>
          <ul class="list list-bullet">
              <li>professional lawyer, tax adviser, accountant</li>
              <li>friend or family relative</li>
            </ul>
          <p>You can use a representative if you feel you need help or advice. A representative is able to receive letters from the tax tribunal and go to any hearings for you.</p>
          <p>If your representative is not a legal professional, youâ€™ll need to authorise them to act for you by completing an <a href="%{approval_form_href}">authorisation form (%{approval_form_format_and_size})</a>.</p>
