// Once a grounds for appeal document has been uploaded, when loading again the same step will give us
// the option to delete said document. The fact we need to ensure the app is functional without javascript,
// forces us to have two separated forms but the arrangement of the 'Remove document' form needs to
// be visually rendered inside the 'Continue' form.
//
// We reposition the 'Remove' button and the 'Continue' button with the following CSS in order to visually
// match the design and original arrangement when javascript is not available.
