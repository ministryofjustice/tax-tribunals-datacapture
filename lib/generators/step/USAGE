Description:
    Generates a step for a given task.

    CAUTION: This requires the task to exist already. It won't create a
    task supercontroller, or task folders, or decision tree - instead
    it will fail unceremoniously.

    Assumes you want to generate an intermediate step, i.e. not a start page
    or "check your answers" page.

Example:
    rails generate step Cost DisputeType

    This will create:
        app/controllers/steps/cost/dispute_type_controller.rb
        app/forms/steps/cost/dispute_type_form.rb
        app/views/steps/cost/dispute_type/edit.html.erb
        spec/controllers/steps/cost/dispute_type_controller_spec.rb
        spec/forms/steps/cost/dispute_type_form_spec.rb

    This will update:
        config/routes.rb
          (adds an `edit_step` route for the step)

    You will have to do yourself:
        - Add the fields into the form object (and write specs)
        - Add the fields to the tribunal_case model (and migrate)
        - Add the relevant form code in the view
        - Update the step X of Y in the view
        - Make the decision tree decide something
        - Add specs for the decision tree
        - Add a value object if required (and add the `has_value_object`
          to the model)
        - Add i18n
